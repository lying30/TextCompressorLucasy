| November 22 |  1-1:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I thought about the problem and I am going to encode every word to like 8 bit coeds and then will max out at 255 words but then after that leave the characters as is. This will be one way to approach the problem. |
| Dec. 3      | 11-11:52am |                                                                                                                                                                                         Worked through the solution we talked about in class in which you utilize 10 bit codes to map out 1024 most common words, so that when you see them in the text file you are compressing you can only use 10 bits instead of however many chars(8bits) it takes to write the word. |
| December 4  |  7-8:45pm  | I went through and read through the text file I made with 1000 words and added them to hashmaps to encode them. I don't know if I did that right, and am a bit unsure about how to approach the comrpess method, but I think I understand what to put in the expand method as it should be a little more straight forward. I didn't finish my V1 and honestly think I will benefit a lot from tomorrow when you introduce the correct way to approach the text compressor. |
